The CP supports\n            interoperability with unauthenticated systems that are not\n            port-based network access control capable, or that lack \n            MKA.  When the access controlled port is supported by a\n            SecY, the CP is capable of controlling the SecY so as to\n            provide unsecured connectivity to systems that implement a\n            PAC.\n\n        EAP : Extensible Authentication Protocol, RFC3748.\n\n        EAPOL : EAP over LANs.\n\n        KaY : Key Agreement Entity, a PAE entity responsible for MKA.\n\n        Key Server : Elected by MKA, to transport a succession of SAKs,\n            for use by MACsec, to the other member(s) of a CA.\n\n        KMD : Key Management Domain, a string identifying systems that\n             share cached CAKs.\n\n        Listener : The role is to receive the network announcement\n            parameters in the authentication process.\n\n        Logon Process : The Logon Process is responsible for the\n            managing the use of authentication credentials, for\n            initiating use of the PAE's Supplicant and or Authenticator\n            functionality, for deriving CAK, CKN tuples from PAE\n            results, for maintaining PSKs (Pre-Sharing Keys), and for\n            managing MKA instances.  In the absence of successful\n            authentication, key agreement, or support for MAC Security,\n            the Logon Process determines whether the CP state machine\n            should provide unauthenticated connectivity or\n            authenticated but unsecured connectivity.\n\n        MKA : MACsec Key Agreement protocol allows PAEs, each\n            associated with a port that is an authenticated member of a\n            secure connectivity association (CA) or a potential CA, to\n            discover other PAEs attached to the same LAN, to confirm\n            mutual possession of a CAK and hence to prove a past mutual\n            authentication, to agree the secret keys (SAKs) used by\n            MACsec for symmetric shared key cryptography, and to ensure\n            that the data protected by MACsec has not been delayed.\n\n        MKPDU : MACsec Key Agreement Protocol Data Unit.\n\n        MPDU : MAC Protocol Data Unit.\n\n        NID : Network Identity, a UTF-8 string identifying an network\n             or network service.\n\n        PAE : Port Access Entity, the protocol entity associated with a\n             Port.  It can support the protocol functionality\n             associated with the Authenticator, the Supplicant, or\n             both.\n\n        PAC : Port Access Controller, a protocol-less shim that\n             provides control over frame transmission and reception by\n             clients attached to its Controlled Port, and uses the MAC\n             Service provided by a Common Port.  The access control\n             decision is made by the PAE, typically taking into\n             account the success or failure of mutual authentication\n             and authorization of the PAE's peer(s), and is\n             communicated by the PAE using the LMI to set the PAC's\n             Controlled Port enabled/disable.  Two different interfaces\n             'Controlled Port' and 'Uncontrolled Port', are associated\n             with a PAC, and that for each instance of a PAC, two\n             ifTable rows (one for each interface) run on top of an\n             ifTable row representing the 'Common Port' interface,\n             such as a row with ifType = 'ethernetCsmacd(6)'.\n\n             For example :\n            -----------------------------------------------------------\n            |                            |                            |\n            |   Controlled Port          |   Uncontrolled Port        |\n            |      Interface             |      Interface             |\n            |    (ifEntry = j)           |     (ifEntry = k)          |\n            | (ifType =                  | (ifType =                  |\n            |  macSecControlledIF(231))  |  macSecUncontrolledIF(232))|\n            |                            |                            |\n            |---------------------------------------------------------|\n            |                                                         |\n            |                    Physical Interface                   |\n            |                      (ifEntry = i)                      |\n            |                (ifType = ethernetCsmacd(6))             |\n            |_________________________________________________________|\n                        i, j, k are ifIndex to indicate\n                       an interface stack in the ifTable.\n                        Figure : PAC Interface Stack\n\n             The 'Controlled Port' is the service point to provide one\n             instance of the secure MAC service in a PAC.  The\n             'Uncontrolled Port' is the service point to provide one\n             instance of the insecure MAC service in a PAC.\n\n        PACP : Port Access Controller Protocol.\n\n        Port Identifier : A 16-bit identifier that uniquely identifies each of\n        \ta system's transmit SCs that uses the same MAC address as a\n        \tcomponent of its SCI.\n\n        Real Port : Indicates the PAE is for a real port.  A port that\n            is not created on demand by the mechanisms specified in\n            this standard, but that can transmit and receive frames for\n            one or more virtual ports.\n\n        SC : Secure Channel, a security relationship used to provide\n            security guarantees for frames transmitted from one member\n            of a CA to the others.  An SC is supported by a sequence of\n            SAs thus allowing the periodic use of fresh keys without\n            terminating the relationship.\n\n        SA : Secure Association, a security relationship that provides\n            security guarantees for frames transmitted from one member\n            of a CA to the others. Each SA is supported by a single\n            secret key, or a single set of keys where the cryptographic\n            operations used to protect one frame require more than one\n            key. \n\n        SAK : Secure Association key, the secret key used by an SA.\n\n        SCI : Secure Channel Identifier, a unique identifier for a secure \n        \tchannel, comprising a MAC Address and a Port Identifier.\n\n        secured connectivity : Data transfer between two or 'Controlled\n            Ports' that is protected by MACsec.\n\n        SecY : MAC Security Entity, the entity that operates the MAC\n            Security protocol within a system.\n\n        Supplicant : An entity at one end of a point-to-point LAN\n            segment that seeks to be authenticated by an Authenticator\n            attached to the other end of that link.\n            \n        Suspension: Temporary suspension of MKA operation to facilitate\n            in-service control plane software upgrades without\n            disrupting existing secure connectivity.\n\n        Uncontrolled Port : The access point used to provide the\n            insecure MAC Service to a client of a SecY or PAC.\n\n        Virtual Port : Indicates the PAE is for a virtual port.  A MAC\n            Service or Internal Sublayer service access point that is\n            created on demand.  Virtual ports can be used to provide\n            separate secure connectivity associations over the same\n            LAN.")
