Bits 0-19 contain\n                a label or a reserved label value.  Bits 20-31\n                MUST be zero.\n\n                The following is quoted directly from [RFC3032].\n                There are several reserved label values:\n\n                   i. A value of 0 represents the\n                      'IPv4 Explicit NULL Label'.  This label\n                      value is only legal at the bottom of the\n                      label stack.  It indicates that the label\n                      stack must be popped, and the forwarding\n                      of the packet must then be based on the\n                      IPv4 header.\n\n                  ii. A value of 1 represents the\n                      'Router Alert Label'.  This label value is\n                      legal anywhere in the label stack except at\n                      the bottom.  When a received packet\n                      contains this label value at the top of\n                      the label stack, it is delivered to a\n                      local software module for processing.\n                      The actual forwarding of the packet\n                      is determined by the label beneath it\n                      in the stack.  However, if the packet is\n                      forwarded further, the Router Alert Label\n                      should be pushed back onto the label stack\n                      before forwarding.  The use of this label\n                      is analogous to the use of the\n                      'Router Alert Option' in IP packets\n                      [RFC2113].  Since this label\n                      cannot occur at the bottom of the stack,\n                      it is not associated with a\n                      particular network layer protocol.\n\n                 iii. A value of 2 represents the\n                      'IPv6 Explicit NULL Label'.  This label\n                      value is only legal at the bottom of the\n                      label stack.  It indicates that the label\n                      stack must be popped, and the forwarding\n                      of the packet must then be based on the\n                      IPv6 header.\n\n                  iv. A value of 3 represents the\n                      'Implicit NULL Label'.\n                      This is a label that an LSR may assign and\n                      distribute, but which never actually\n                      appears in the encapsulation.  When an\n                      LSR would otherwise replace the label\n                      at the top of the stack with a new label,\n                      but the new label is 'Implicit NULL',\n                      the LSR will pop the stack instead of\n                      doing the replacement.  Although\n                      this value may never appear in the\n                      encapsulation, it needs to be specified in\n                      the Label Distribution Protocol, so a value\n                      is reserved.\n\n                   v. Values 4-15 are reserved.\n\n              * The frame relay label can be either 10-bits or\n                23-bits depending on the DLCI field size and the\n                upper 22-bits or upper 9-bits must be zero,\n                respectively.\n\n              * For an ATM label the lower 16-bits represents the\n                VCI, the next 12-bits represents the VPI and the\n                remaining bits MUST be zero.\n\n              * The Generalized-MPLS (GMPLS) label contains a\n                value greater than 2^24-1 and used in GMPLS\n                as defined in [RFC3471]."
