This bit may only\n        be used for packets transmitted by the probe.  Older NMS\n        applications can safely ignore this status bit, which might be\n        used by newer agents.\n\n        2) The packetMatch trap has been removed.  This trap was never\n        actually 'approved' and was not added to this document along\n        with the risingAlarm and fallingAlarm traps. The packetMatch\n        trap could not be throttled, which could cause disruption of\n        normal network traffic under some circumstances. An NMS should\n        configure a risingAlarm threshold on the appropriate\n        channelMatches instance if a trap is desired for a packetMatch\n        event. Note that logging of packetMatch events is still\n        supported--only trap generation for such events has been\n        removed.\n\n        In addition, several clarifications to individual object\n        definitions have been added to assist agent and NMS\n        implementors:\n\n        - global definition of 'good packets' and 'bad packets'\n\n        - more detailed text governing conceptual row creation and\n          modification\n\n        - instructions for probes relating to interface changes and\n          disruptions\n\n        - clarification of some ethernet counter definitions\n\n        - recommended formula for calculating network utilization\n\n        - clarification of channel and captureBuffer behavior for some\n          unusual conditions\n\n        - examples of proper instance naming for each table", 'The original version of this MIB, published as RFC1271.',))

    description = 'The status of a table entry.\n\n        Setting this object to the value invalid(4) has the\n        effect of invalidating the corresponding entry.\n        That is, it effectively disassociates the mapping\n        identified with said entry.\n        It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether\n        the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.\n        Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to\n        receive tabular information from agents that corresponds\n        to entries currently not in use.  Proper\n        interpretation of such entries requires examination\n        of the relevant EntryStatus object.\n\n        An existing instance of this object cannot be set to\n        createRequest(2).  This object may only be set to\n        createRequest(2) when this instance is created.  When\n        this object is created, the agent may wish to create\n        supplemental object instances with default values\n        to complete a conceptual row in this table.  Because the\n        creation of these default objects is entirely at the option\n        of the agent, the manager must not assume that any will be\n        created, but may make use of any that are created.\n        Immediately after completing the create operation, the agent\n        must set this object to underCreation(3).\n\n        When in the underCreation(3) state, an entry is allowed to\n        exist in a possibly incomplete, possibly inconsistent state,\n        usually to allow it to be modified in multiple PDUs.  When in\n        this state, an entry is not fully active.\n        Entries shall exist in the underCreation(3) state until\n        the management station is finished configuring the entry\n        and sets this object to valid(1) or aborts, setting this\n        object to invalid(4).  If the agent determines that an\n        entry has been in the underCreation(3) state for an\n        abnormally long time, it may decide that the management\n        station has crashed.  If the agent makes this decision,\n        it may set this object to invalid(4) to reclaim the\n        entry.  A prudent agent will understand that the\n        management station may need to wait for human input\n        and will allow for that possibility in its\n        determination of this abnormally long period.\n\n        An entry in the valid(1) state is fully configured and\n        consistent and fully represents the configuration or\n        operation such a row is intended to represent.  For\n        example, it could be a statistical function that is\n        configured and active, or a filter that is available\n        in the list of filters processed by the packet capture\n        process.\n\n        A manager is restricted to changing the state of an entry in\n        the following ways:\n\n             To:       valid  createRequest  underCreation  invalid\n        From:\n        valid             OK             NO             OK       OK\n        createRequest    N/A            N/A            N/A      N/A\n        underCreation     OK             NO             OK       OK\n        invalid           NO             NO             NO       OK\n        nonExistent       NO             OK             NO       OK\n\n        In the table above, it is not applicable to move the state\n        from the createRequest state to any other state because the\n        manager will never find the variable in that state.  The\n        nonExistent state is not a value of the enumeration, rather\n        it means that the entryStatus variable does not exist at all.\n        An agent may allow an entryStatus variable to change state in\n        additional ways, so long as the semantics of the states are\n        followed.  This allowance is made to ease the implementation of\n        the agent and is made despite the fact that managers should\n        never exercise these additional state transitions.'
