EriAlarmType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
        DISPLAY-HINT "d"
        STATUS current
        DESCRIPTION
                "A unique identification of the fault, not
                including the managed object.  Alarm types are
                used to identify if alarms indicate the same
                problem or not, for lookup into external alarm
                documentation, etc.  A unique alarm type is
                identified using the combination of two instances
                of EriAlarmType. Different managed object
                types and instances can share alarm types.  But
                if the same managed object reports the same alarm
                type, it is to be considered to be the same alarm
                state. The alarm type is a simplification of the
                different X.733 and 3GPP alarm IRP alarm
                correlation mechanisms based on EventType,
                ProbableCause, SpecificProblem and
                NotificationId."

        DESCRIPTION

                shall never change its index during the lifetime
                of the entry; for example renumbering entries is
                not allowed when entries are deleted.
                Renumbering after an agent restart is allowed.
                Note that this index shall not be used to
                identify alarms when performing
                resynchronization, etc. The logical identity for
                an alarm instance is the managed object and alarm
                type."
