The base address of a card can no longer be set through Pegasus Management, but only through the CLI on the card itself. The remaining objects were renumbered to keep the numbering compact, so this revision of the MIB is again NOT COMPATIBLE with preceeding revisions! Changed the type of perfControlIndex and perfDataIndex from INTEGER to Integer32, with range (1..2147483647), which is the set of positive values possible for an Integer32. This change is rather formal (Integer32 is indistinguishable from INTEGER, as SNMPv2-SMI puts it, that is, its serialisation is identical to INTEGER), but it makes certain parsers happy. In fact, the value is always chosen by the client, and the agent gladly takes what it gets - including 0 and negative values."

Added new literals at end of DataPortSpeedEnum and DataPortFlowControlEnum to convey that the value of a (read-only) status variable is currently unknown (for example because a sub-device like the Iad cannot be queried because is not connected). Added four new objects to the Iad table, to describe configuration and corresponding status of the Ethernet port on the Iad. This was mandated by the Iad Rev. B, which can control its Ethernet port and also report its status. For the older Iad Rev. B, control and status of the Ethernet port are not available, and the new objects will read with fixed values.
